Using CI tools like jenkins we can automate process like building, packaging, deployement and testing. supports parallel deployements.

CI: continous integration is a development practice in which the developers are required to commit changes to the source code in a shared repository several times a day or more frequently.

Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in java with plugins built for continious integration purpose.Plugins allows integration of various DevOps stages.

***An open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test and deploy their software

Issues faced before CI:
1.Long waits to test code
2.Difficult to debug
3.Slow software delivery process
4.Infrequent feedback cycles

pipeline - step by step execution

Version Control --> Build --> Unit test -->Deploy -->auto test -->deploy to production -->measure validate

-->Jenkins is a open source project written in java that runs on windows, linux, MacOS
-->Consist of plugins
-->It was developed by sun microsystem


-->Jnekins master will distribute its workload to its slaves
-->Jenkins slaves are generally required to provide the desired environment. it works on the basis of request received from jenkins master

Jenkins setup

Why QA needs to learn jenkins
-->Runs automated test suites
-->run you web, mobile automation suites
-->API Monitoring
-->Report and email notification
-->trends and detailed failure that can be shared
-->you can use slave to make build and run fast


FreeStyle job in jenkins
-->Freestyle means improvised or unresttricted.
-->According to the official jenkins wiki, a freestyle project is a typical build job or task. this could be as simple as running tests, building or packaging an application, sending a report, or even running some commads. Before any tests are run, data is collated.

Jenkins freestyle project is a repeatable build job, script, or pipeline that contains steps and post-build actions
